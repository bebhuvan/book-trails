          <div class="space-y-6 text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              In an age of algorithmic recommendations and endless content, finding truly meaningful books can feel overwhelming. 
              That's where <em>Mentioned</em> comes in.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that the most powerful book recommendations come not from marketing campaigns or bestseller lists, 
              but from the authentic mentions found in the writings of people whose judgment we trust. When Nicholas Carr 
              references Lewis Mumford, or when Paul Krugman cites Barry Eichengreen, these aren't just citationsâ€”they're 
              windows into the intellectual genealogies that shape great thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is simple: to surface these authentic book mentions from notable writers, thinkers, and creators, 
              providing you with a curated pathway to discover books that have genuinely influenced thoughtful minds.

            <p>
              Every mention on this site is carefully curated from published works, interviews, essays, and other credible sources.

            <p>Not every book mention makes it onto our platform. We maintain high standards for inclusion:</p>
            <ul class="space-y-3 ml-6">
              <li><strong>Notable Voices:</strong> The mentioner must be a recognized expert, published author, or respected thinker in their field.</li>
              <li><strong>Substantial Context:</strong> Casual or superficial references don't qualify. We look for meaningful engagement with the book's ideas.</li>
              <li><strong>Verifiable Sources:</strong> Every mention is linked back to its original source, whether that's a published book, academic paper, interview, or credible publication.</li>
              <li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> We focus on books that contribute to serious discourse, regardless of their popularity or recency.</li>
