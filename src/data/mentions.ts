      fullContext: "Paul Krugman: Now, it probably annoys you as much as it annoys me to have people talk about your great work, stuff that's so far in the past you can barely remember having done it, but you wrote a really great book, Golden Fetters, about the gold standard and the Great Depression. Do you want to talk about that a little bit? Because I think it is relevant to where we are.\n\nBarry Eichengreen: Well, I think the point of that book was, in part, that simple rigid rules are not a reliable guide for the conduct of monetary policy, and leaving it to the good judgment of an individual, be he in the boardroom of the Fed or the White House, is not a good arrangement either. We have been moving toward constrained discretion over time, where an independent central bank has discretion over monetary policy. But it faces constraints from its mandate, where the powers that be have kind of laid down what objectives it should pursue. And I do think that if you go back to the gold standard, it also functioned best when politicians didn't get in the way.\n\nBefore 1913, when political pressures were relatively limited, the extent of the franchise who could vote was limited in most countries, men of property in most places, white male adults in the United States. Trade unions were relatively unimportant, so people clamoring for lower interest rates to bring down unemployment wasn't a factor. All that changed after World War I with extensions of the franchise, the rise of labor unions and parliamentary labor parties. So with those pressures, the gold standard became more fragile and ultimately came crashing down in the Great Depression. So I think that tells you that no monetary ruler or regime is immune from political pressure, but you need an adequate setup, you need adequate institutions to contain that pressure.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah. Supposedly when FDR took the U.S. off the gold standard, his budget director said \"This is the end of Western civilization.\" So there was a view that it was really critical. You stole the phrase \"golden fetters\" from Keynes, but it was basically these kinds of chains that prevented countries from responding effectively to the Great Depression. Finding a way to have flexibility without opening the door to abuse of that flexibility was a long process, and we ended up with this modern regime of the independent central bank, ultimately answerable to the political process, but not quickly. But now technocrats and all of that is suddenly on the line again.\n\nBarry Eichengreen: Yeah, the idea that the central bank is independent but accountable to the politicians, that idea rests on the notion that the politicians will punish the central bank when it acts recklessly, but it will reward the central bank if it behaves responsibly. We're about to find out whether the United States is still operating in that kind of world.",

They're always different, but that doesn't mean they're not a bubble. And the same thing is happening here.\n\nI have a diagram I use a lot from 1995.

It was clear that everyone was going to have some kind of computer thing connected to some kind of network. Remember the phrase \"information superhighway,\" which sort of conveyed that it would be centralized and controlled by cable companies and phone companies and media companies, which is how everything had always previously worked. It wasn't clear that it was going to be the internet. It wasn't clear the internet was going to be kind of radically decentralized and permissionless, and anyone could do what they wanted.

      fullContext: "Benedict Evans: Part of this is that like in most non-emotive fields, we kind of do, like you understand, people understand that, you know, if you make, you know, more employment regulation tends to produce slower growth but more protection for employment and you you're choosing a trade-off. You, people kind of I think everybody on both sides of that equation understands that that, that's a trade-off and you're choosing one versus the other.\n\nThe point is you can have a fully functioning free market and you can regulate some of the negative externalities of free markets that anybody in any part of the economic spectrum understands there are negative externalities to free markets. You can also have like a government provided alternative. You can have the government do the fire department where you have some of the kind of most obvious gaps between the US and Europe it seems to me sometimes are in places where you kind of have neither.\n\nSo the US neither has a government-controlled healthcare system nor a free market healthcare system. Do you see what I mean? You have neither a government-controlled housing which you have in like in weird places like Singapore nor a free market in housing. So you kind of break the free market. So you stop the price signaling. This is like the great insight of Hayek is that pricing is a signal. Pricing is an information system. It's telling people what's wanted. It's not, it's not just a signal of worth. It's a signal of demand.\n\nThere's a, a fascinating book I read a while ago called \"Red Plenty,\" which is about Soviet central planning in the '60s, '70s, '80s and it's about sort of what happens when you have a central planning that just cannot cope with the level of complexity of a sophisticated economy in the '60s and '70s as opposed to let's make grain and tractors and locomotives in the '20s and '30s and steel which already kind of works. But once you actually have a sophisticated industrial economy, central planning can't handle the complexity. And so you try and create incentives and structures around that while not having pricing and that just doesn't work.\n\nI suppose there's a sort of a generalized point which is like a market economy is a system and if you pull a lever here something will move there and you can't just pull a lever here and say, \"Well, I don't want that to move because it's a democracy.\" It will move anyway and so you have to understand how the system works and understand what consequences you want from that and what your parameter, parameters are within this.",

He draws on cognitive psychology, psychiatry, and media studies to produce a diagnosis of the \"post-truth\" condition.\n\nThat Pierre's project remains stable, and his thesis retains both vitality and viability, is a testament to his scholarly rigor and the excellence of this book.",

I'd always thought of India's partition as only involving India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\n\nShattered Lands by @SamDalrymple123 is a must-read for history buffs. And thanks to good genes, I guess. :)\n\nThe Anarchy by @DalrympleWill is still one of my favourites. It tells the story of how the East India Company came to India to trade, became immensely wealthy, and, in their pursuit of more, became ruthless.\n\nIt makes me wonder: today, as trillion-dollar companies rise, what happens if they turn evil, too?",

      fullContext: "This is the best book I've read this year. It is also an important book. In a world obsessed with AI, Max Bennett (@maxsbennett) approaches intelligence from a key point of view: biology.\n\nA Brief History of Intelligence assembles the many mechanisms that contribute to intelligence in chronological order. This is not just clever structure. By explaining the problem each mechanism solves you get a deep understanding of why intelligence emerged and how it differs among species.\n\nIn this theory, intelligence emerges in animals because, unlike plants who can produce their own food, or fungi who eat what is already dead, animals roam the environment in search for something to kill and eat. In some ways, animals developed intelligence because we started in the worse ecological niche and were forced to innovate to survive.\n\nThese innovations start with the problem of deciding a common direction of motion in a multicellular organism. One of the things I found extremely refreshing, is that Bennet explains these mechanisms by summarizing experiments on c. elegans, a microscopic worm with about 300 or so neurons, that can be used to understand a primitive dopamine system and even emotions.\n\nDo you ever feel like running away when you are in an uncomfortable situation? Do you like dancing when things go your way? Well, so does this little worm.\n\nThe book is filled with clever experiments that help separate the intelligence of worms, fish, and us, while showing that we still have much in common. When do we start recognizing patterns, and why? Why do the mechanisms that allow us to learn can lead to addiction? Why is imagination a key to intelligence?\n\nFrom the basics of sensory input, valence, and motility Bennet takes us into neurochemistry, reinforcement learning, and credit assignment problems, showing that what we consider cutting edge research in machine learning is often something that evolution solved over one hundred million years ago. A truly refreshing read that humbles the field of AI while putting it into a broader perspective.\n\nI would recommend this book to everyone interested in AI. After all, it is about something more general. About the I, no matter if it comes with an A or not. It is about the common problems that lead to the development of that I, and how these are shared by biological and artificial systems.\n\n5 stars!!",

Even the chapter title—a divided conscience—is chef's kiss.\n\nIt profiles a devote Confucian civil servant (Li Zhi) who at the age of 50 decides the tartuffery is just too much and becomes a buddhist monk.\n\nbut his fate was to be the same as all of 1587's protagonists: a group whose fascinating \"toil and trouble proved to be only futile.\"\n\nAn aside, his China: A Macro History is also really good, concise, often incisive intro text overviewing the duration of the country's history.\n\nI don't know of any that do a better job!",
